Context Learning: Behavioral Pilot Task
=========

Adapting the experimental paradigm from [Gershman (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-016-1110-x) into a within-subject behavioral pilot for an fMRI study. Written in psychopy

This is included just for reference. A better version of the code was used in the [actual fMRI task](https://github.com/tomov/Context-Learning-fMRI-Task). The main difference is here we tried to make psychopy randomize the stimuli on the fly. Big mistake.
